        Riding transit <strong>should be as easy as buying a cup of coffee</strong>: Regardless of what
        customers order or where the coffee shop is, they know they can instantly pay by tapping their
        contactless bank card or smart device.

        But most California transit providers only accept regional fare cards or cash in exact change. These
        legacy fare systems are expensive to maintain and create barriers for new riders.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s time for California to tap into the future of fare payment. <strong>Nearly 75% of Californians have
          access to a contactless credit/debit card</strong>, and most have a smart device as well. Travelers
        will be more likely to choose transit if they can use what’s already in their pocket to pay for it—just
        like they pay for coffee.
