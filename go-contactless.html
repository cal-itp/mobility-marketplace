            Riding transit <strong>should be as easy as buying a cup of coffee</strong>: Regardless of what
            customers order or where the coffee shop is, they know they can instantly pay by tapping their
            contactless bank card or smart device.
          </p>
          <p>
            But most California transit providers only accept regional fare cards or cash in exact change. These
            legacy fare systems are expensive to maintain and create barriers for new riders.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s time for California to tap into the future of fare payment. <strong>Nearly 75% of Californians have
            access to a contactless credit/debit card</strong>, and most have a smart device as well. Travelers
            will be more likely to choose transit if they can use what’s already in their pocket to pay for it—just
            like they pay for coffee.
