  On behalf of <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/">Caltrans</a>, Cal-ITP can connect you with pre-approved contracts and
  competitive rates to help you modernize your transit system. We recommend creating an action plan for becoming
  GTFS-compliant before going contactless.

  To add contactless fare collection, you will need to procure up to three new technologies:
</p>

{% for technology in page.new_technology %}
  <article class="contactless-technology">
    <div class="contactless-technology__icon">
      <img src="/uploads/{{ technology.icon }}" alt="{{ technology.icon-alt }}" />
    </div>
    <div class="contactless-technology__content">
      <h2 class="contactless-technology__header h3">{{ technology.title }}</h2>

      <div class="mb-4">
        {{ technology.content | markdownify }}
      </div>

      {% if technology.url %}
        <a class="btn btn-primary px-5" href="{{ technology.url }}">
      {% else %}
        <p class="text-red"><em><strong>
      {% endif %}

      {{ technology.button }}

      {% if technology.url %}
        </a>
      {% else %}
        </strong></em></p>
      {% endif %}
    </div>
  </article>
