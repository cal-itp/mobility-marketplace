<h2 id="fare-calculation-software" class="h3">Fare calculation software (transit processor services)</h2>

<p>
  Recognizes riders' unique payment methods and charges the best fare for each trip, accounting for applicable
  discounts and distance traveled. It also enables "fare capping," meaning that riders will no longer be charged
  for additional trips after reaching the cost of an unlimited pass.

<p>
  On-board or platform devices equipped with NFC and cEMV technology to read and validate riders'
  contactless bank cards and smart devices.
