        <h2 id="fare-calculation-software" class="h3">Fare calculation software</h2>

        <p>
          Recognizes riders' unique payment methods and charges the best fare for each trip, accounting for applicable
          discounts and distance traveled. It also enables "fare capping," meaning that riders will no longer be charged
          for additional trips after reaching the cost of an unlimited pass.
