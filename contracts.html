        To add contactless fare collection, transit providers will need to procure up to three new technologies:
      </p>

      <main>
        <h2 id="payment-processor" class="h3">Payment processor</h2>

        <p>
          Back-end service that transmits fares from riders' bank cards and smart devices to transit providers' bank
          accounts.

        <h2 id="fare-calculation-software" class="h3">Fare calculation software</h2>

        <p>
          Recognizes riders' unique payment methods and charges the best fare for each trip, accounting for applicable
          discounts and distance traveled. It also enables "fare capping," meaning that riders will no longer be charged
          for additional trips after reaching the cost of an unlimited pass.

        <h2 id="fare-validators" class="h3">Fare validators</h2>

        <p>
          On-board or platform devices equipped with NFC and cEMV technology to read and validate riders'
          contactless bank cards and smart devices.
