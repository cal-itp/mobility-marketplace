Welcome to the California Mobility Marketplace!

Managed by [Cal-ITP](http://www.calitp.org), this website seeks to make the transition to contactless fare collection and GTFS Realtime compliance as easy and cost-effective as possible through a new and innovative approach. 

The California Mobility Marketplace gathers and presents links to a suite of pre-negotiated, code-compliant products and services that providers need in order to offer both contactless fare collection and GTFS Realtime, whether operating buses, commuter trains, or light rail. 

This means that all the procurement work has already been done for you. Vendors have responded and been awarded contracts through a competitively bid process—so transit providers don’t have to handle procurement on their own. 

The Mobility Marketplace serves as Cal-ITP’s online catalogue, where transit providers can browse these technologies and build a customized fare collection system that suits their needs. Visit our [procurement page](https://www.camobilitymarketplace.org/contact) to start exploring goods and services  that have already been approved. Don’t yet see what you’re looking for? Cal-ITP continues to search for  code-compliant goods and services that meet the needs of the industry, so be sure to check back often for newly available products and services. You can also [sign up for our mailing list](https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/eLbtFoE/calitp?source_id=a41b99cd-7f28-4be8-a286-f9e75fc7bbce&source_type=em&c=).
