**General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)**: Common format for public transit providers to publish data about their transit services. Transit providers publish their schedules, base price, and certain geospatial data in this open standard so that third parties and mapping applications native to mobile phones can build a variety of applications, including trip planning software, for transit riders. GTFS is categorized into two different typologies:

* *GTFS Schedule dataset*: Schedules, fares, and fixed geographic information stored as a zipped file of .txt files.
* <span id="gtfs-rt"></span>*GTFS Realtime (GTFS-RT)*: Vehicle positioning, stop-based arrival times, service advisories. <br/><br/>

GTFS is referred to as an “extensible” format.  This means that GTFS was intended to accommodate future growth, for example through new functions, or through modifications of existing functionality. This leads to:

**GTFS extensions under development**:

* *GTFS-Fares*: Components of GTFS Schedule which describe transit fare information. The version under consideration for adoption in 2021 is “GTFS-Fares v2”.
* *GTFS-Flex*: Describes demand-responsive transit operations and coverage.
