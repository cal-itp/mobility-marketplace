Contactless fare collection allows riders to pay for public transit using the same payment methods they use for other everyday purchases. This page explains the different methods that riders will soon be able to use to tap to pay for transit across California.

## Contactless bank cards

A contactless bank card is a credit, debit, or reloadable prepaid card that riders can simply tap on a fare validator to pay. Contactless cards use near-field communication (NFC) technology, which lets the card communicate with a terminal to quickly complete transactions without having to insert or swipe.

Not sure if a card is contactless? Look for the <img src="/assets/uploads/contactless-symbol-small.png" width="12px"> symbol on either the front or the back of the card. If you see it, you’re ready to tap to pay today! If not, you can contact your bank or financial institution to request a contactless replacement card free of charge.

## Prepaid cards

Transit riders who do not have a credit or debit card can use a contactless prepaid card. Prepaid cards allow riders to tap to pay even if they don’t have a bank account or credit score. Once they have a card, they can top up online or, depending on the card, add cash at an authorized retailer—and then they’re ready to ride!

## Smart devices

Riders can also tap to pay using their smartphone, smartwatch, or other wearable, including Fitbit or Garmin devices. They simply need to link their credit or debit card to their device’s mobile wallet—which includes built-in apps like Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay—to transform their personal smart device into a contactless transit ticket. 

Fun fact: Riders can link their bank card to their smart device whether or not the card is contactless-enabled.
