California residents face a complex and disaggregated public transportation network that can be confusing for riders to navigate and expensive for transit providers to operate. The [California Integrated Travel Project](https://www.calitp.org/) (Cal-ITP) is a series of initiatives to ensure that public transit in California leverages modern industry standards and specifications for seamless journey planning and fare payment. Cal-ITP is dedicated to making travel simpler and more cost-effective for both transit providers and riders through three main program areas: 

* Access to contactless fare collection systems 
* Seamless verification of eligibility for transit discounts, such as those for older adults, students, veterans, and people with disabilities
* Reliable, real-time, and easily accessible information about available transportation options and their prices

Supported by the [California State Transportation Agency](https://calsta.ca.gov/) (CalSTA) and the [California Department of Transportation](https://calsta.ca.gov/) (Caltrans) through a grant from the [California Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program](https://calsta.ca.gov/subject-areas/transit-intercity-rail-capital-prog) (TIRCP), Cal-ITP was established to help California deliver on statewide goals of: 

* Improving the customer experience
* Increasing transit ridership
* Lowering costs for transit providers and riders
* Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to reach environmental targets
* Promoting equitable access to transportation across the state’s transit providers

In operating as a statewide program, Cal-ITP can help California tackle carbon emissions across the state by coordinating transit initiatives across jurisdictions. Cal-ITP supports the state’s longer-term climate, equity, and economic development goals—as delineated in California Executive Order [N-79-20](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.23.20-EO-N-79-20-text.pdf)—by ensuring that transit remains a core tenet of mobility. And by working collectively across geographical boundaries, localities can leverage California’s buying power to save on procurement.

This initiative is critical now more than ever. As COVID-19 hit the United States, many transit providers saw ridership decrease. But many who depend on transit do not have the privilege to work from home—including many essential workers. Reliable transit access and contactless payments are critical components to ensuring that transit forms a key part of the COVID-19 crisis response and recovery.

Reliable transit access and contactless payments are critical components to ensuring that transit is a part of the COVID crisis response and recovery. Cal-ITP can help bring riders back to transit through modern conveniences that make riding transit easier, while contactless fare collection will speed boarding, keeping both transit vehicle operators and riders safe.
