title: California transit providers
headline: California transit providers
about: >-
  This dataset includes known transit providers in California, covering public
  transit operators, intercity, and special services that may not fall within
  standard definitions of transit. Each provider entry includes its headquarter
  city, counties where active, the associated National Transit Database (NTD) ID
  (if available), the website URL, and key attributes from the NTD. It is
  currently limited to providers who operate their own services. 


  This list is a living document that will be updated regularly with new service provider information. If you have comments, additions, or corrections to this dataset, we're working on ways for you to share that feedback. Please check back soon.
