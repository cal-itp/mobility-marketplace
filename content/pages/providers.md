title: California Transit Providers
headline: California Transit Providers
about: >-
  This dataset includes known transportation providers in California, covering
  both public transit operators and special services that may not fall within
  standard definitions of transit. Each provider entry includes its headquarters
  city, counties where active, the associated National Transit Database ID (if
  available), the website URL, and key attributes from the NTD. It's currently
  limited to providers who operate their own services. 


  This list is a living document that will be updated regularly with new service provider information. If you have comments, additions or corrections to this dataset, we're working on ways for you to share that feedback. Please check back soon.
