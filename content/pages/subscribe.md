On behalf of Caltrans, Cal-ITP can connect you with pre-approved vendors and competitive rates to help you modernize your transit sytem. To start the switch to contactless fare collection, you’ll need just three things:


### Payment processor
Back-end service that transmits fares from riders’ bank cards and smart devices to transit providers’ bank accounts.

**Current vendors**: Elavon, Fiserv

### Fare calculation software
Recognizes riders’ unique payment methods and charges the best fare for each trip, accounting for applicable discounts and distance traveled. It also enables “fare capping,” meaning that riders will no longer be charged for additional trips after reaching the cost of an unlimited pass.

**Current vendors**: Littlepay


### Fare validators
On-board or platform devices equipped with NFC and cEMV technology to read and validate riders’ contactless bank cards and smart devices.

**Current vendors**: *Coming soon—sign up below for updates.*
