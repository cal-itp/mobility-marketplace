  An Excel workbook intended for when an agency is ready to start creating cost estimates for purchasing tap to pay hardware and software. You can use this workbook to compare MSA-awarded vendors’ maximum prices and develop ballpark estimates for budgeting purposes (and board presentations), and make scoping decisions as you prepare to email vendors during the vendor engagement phase.

  <b class="text-body-xl">Note:</b> The prices in this workbook are maximums. Transit agencies are strongly encouraged to reach out to vendors directly for tailored pricing. Prices may be reduced and/or fee categories waived, at vendors’ sole discretion.
