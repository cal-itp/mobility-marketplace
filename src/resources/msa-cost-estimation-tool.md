page filename has to match a slug in resources.yml

right now this is the only resource that doesn't supply a description via front-matter
the template instead conditionally injects its own HTML. this is a code smell!

TODO: either simplify this text so that we no longer need to inject HTML or figure out a way to pass it through 👇 from this page safely.

An Excel workbook intended for when an agency is ready to start creating cost estimates for purchasing tap to pay hardware and software. You can use this workbook to compare MSA-awarded vendors’ maximum prices and develop ballpark estimates for budgeting purposes (and board presentations), and make scoping decisions as you prepare to email vendors during the vendor engagement phase.

<b class="text-body-xl">Note:</b> The prices in this workbook are maximums. Transit agencies are strongly encouraged to reach out to vendors directly for tailored pricing. Prices may be reduced and/or fee categories waived, at vendors’ sole discretion.
