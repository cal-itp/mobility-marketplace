  <h2 class="text-start">Commonly asked questions</h2>

  <h3 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3">How is this support free?</h3>
  <p>The support provided by Cal-ITP to adopt the products and services found on the Mobility Marketplace is funded through grants provided by the state of California.</p>
  <h3 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Can I have help on one or multiple projects?</h3>
  <p>The Cal-ITP Customer Success team is here to support you across data plans, route scheduling, GTFS Realtime, tap to pay, and rider benefits. Some agencies tackle multiple projects at the same time, others one by one.</p>
  <h3 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3">What is an MSA?</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.dgs.ca.gov/">California Department of General Services<span aria-label="(external link)">↗</span></a> (DGS), in collaboration with Cal-ITP, conducted a Request for Proposals that established competitively awarded Master Service Agreements (MSAs), contracts that allow U.S. public transportation providers to purchase directly from California’s DGS without further competitive bidding. Out-of-state transit providers can also participate. Each transit provider should determine whether use of the MSAs is consistent with its procurement policies and regulations.</p>
  <p>Projects resulting from these MSAs may be funded through grants from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and/or the State of California, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and other sources of local and state public funding. Check with your funding agencies.</p>
  <h3 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Can our agency continue to support cash based populations with a tap to pay system?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Tap to pay is simply another option for your riders. If you want to discuss options for supporting cash-based populations with new technologies, please reach out to <a href="mailto:hello@calitp.org" aria-label="hello at cal i t p dot org">hello@calitp.org</a> to discuss further.</p>
  <h3 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3">My agency is not in California, can I use this information? Can I get support from Cal-ITP?</h3>
  <p>Out-of-state transit providers can follow the guide content and incorporate the MSA into your contract. The MSAs listed on this site are examples of a “state purchasing schedule,”  which are agreements between a state or related entity and vendor(s) to provide goods or services at agreed-upon prices. Fundamentally, they are designed to accommodate other parties that may enter into and benefit from the agreements in the future. You’ll sign a contract with the vendors directly.</p>
  <p>The terms and conditions (and pricing) from the MSA are incorporated by reference in the contract that you will sign. You can use a California STD-213 or another DGS approved user agreement or equivalent. Cal-ITP is unable to provide account management support.</p>
  <h3 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3">What rider benefits or discounts are offered?</h3>
  <p>Currently, Veterans, CalFresh, Agencies, Older Adults, and Medicare rider benefits and discounts are supported.</p>
