            Riding transit <strong>should be as easy as buying a cup of coffee</strong>: Regardless of what customers order or
            where the coffee shop is, they know they can instantly pay by tapping their contactless bank card or smart device.
          </p>
          <p>
            But most California transit providers only accept regional fare cards or cash in exact change. These legacy fare
            systems are expensive to maintain and create barriers for new riders.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s time for California to tap into the future of fare payment.
            <strong>Nearly 75% of Californians have access to a contactless credit/debit card</strong>, and most have a smart
            device as well. Travelers will be more likely to choose transit if they can use what’s already in their pocket to pay
            for it—just like they pay for coffee.
