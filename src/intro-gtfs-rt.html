    <p>
      <strong>Where is my bus?</strong> Real-time data is how both riders and operators answer this question. GTFS allows you to
      see your vehicle—in real time, on a map.
    </p>
    <h2>So, what exactly is GTFS?</h2>
    <p>
      GTFS feeds allow public transit agencies to share their transit data, making it easier for developers to create applications
      that can use this information effectively. Transit service providers produce schedules and prices; third-party applications
      (like Google Maps, Transit App, etc.) consume this data. Riders use this data to plan for their transit trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main components: Schedule and Realtime. GTFS Schedule is the plan of what transit service looks like; GTFS
      Realtime is what is actually happening with the transit service.
    </p>

        <h4>GTFS Schedule</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 rounded rounded-1 border border-warning bg-warning-subtle">
        <h4>GTFS Schedule</h4>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      GTFS Schedule is the backbone of transit data. GTFS Schedule and GTFS Realtime depend on each other. GTFS Realtime needs
      GTFS Schedule to give it the baseline operations assumptions. It then enhances this data by adding in real-time data.
    </p>
    <p>They each provide comprehensive information in a standardized format.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6 rounded rounded-1 border border-info bg-info-subtle">
        <h4>GTFS Schedule</h4>

      <div class="col-md-6 rounded rounded-1 border border-warning bg-warning-subtle">
        <h4>GTFS Schedule</h4>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Because GTFS is standardized, you can easily integrate your data with third party applications and build on top of it with
      other vendors.
    </p>
    <h2>Power of GTFS Realtime</h2>
    <h3>Enhancing rider experience & operational efficiency </h3>
    <p>
      For transit riders, knowing when a bus or train will actually arrive reduces uncertainty, increases the attractiveness of
      transit, and improves rider satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>For operators, real time brings operational insights and supports the ability to dispatch vehicles in emergencies.</p>
    <h3>Meet your riders on the apps they already use</h3>
    <p>
      Real-time transit data comes in many forms but only one—the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)—provides a universal
      template that is compatible regardless of who produced it or who wants to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That means that no matter who your GTFS vendor is, common third-party transit apps like Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Transit
      App can use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With GTFS, you can meet your riders where they are, no need to download a special app; they will be able to see transit
      options in apps they already use.

    <h2>How do I get GTFS?</h2>
    <p>
      You can create GTFS Schedule with a planning and scheduling software. If your agency has received 5311 funding in the last 3
      years, you may be eligible for a
      <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/13WkzY7taSoSdxBATWsNedQ3aanu">free Remix license</a> provided by CalSTA and Caltrans.
      Remix is a comprehensive transportation planning and scheduling software tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can adopt GTFS Realtime with your own hardware or purchase directly from vendors via MSAs (Master Service Agreements).
      California DGS competitively awards contracts or MSAs to vendors
      <a href="/contracts/view?contracts-filter-product=GTFS-RT/">offering standardized GTFS Realtime products</a>.

    <h2>Quality GTFS Schedule leads to Quality GTFS Realtime</h2>
    <p>
      Caltrans developed the
      <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/cal-itp/california-transit-data-guidelines">California Transit Data Guidelines</a> to help
      ensure transit data meets riders’ expectations. The Guidelines address several key features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Publication of GTFS Schedule and Realtime data, including service alerts and accessibility info</li>
      <li>Availability of GTFS feeds on open-source feed aggregators, with an open data license</li>
      <li>Real-time data feeds (APIs) with an uptime greater than 99%</li>
      <li>Designation of a single point of contact at each transit agency</li>
      <li>A documented process for improving data quality and supporting processes and technology</li>
    </ul>
