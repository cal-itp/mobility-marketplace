        Study after study shows that transit riders have come to expect real-time vehicle arrival information. Knowing when a bus or train will actually arrive reduces uncertainty, increases the attractiveness of transit, and improves rider satisfaction.

      <p class="text-white">The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a data standard that public transit agencies use to get real-time (GTFS-RT) information to their riders. GTFS feeds allow public transit agencies to share their transit data, making it easier for developers to create applications that can use this information effectively. Transit service providers produce schedules and prices, third-party applications (like Apple Maps, Google Maps, Transit App, etc.) consume this data, and riders use this data to plan for their transit trip.</p>

## Prepare

### How do I get started?

#### Cal-ITP will provide the resource materials and technical support you need to begin sharing standardized real-time information with your riders.

To help us better assist you, we ask that you complete an [interest form](/contact){:target="\_blank"} to request Cal-ITP support. With this information, we can determine how best to support you—from developing a project scope, getting buy-in from internal stakeholders, and engaging with vendors, to implementing your new GTFS-Realtime system.

After you complete the form, we welcome you to browse the [GTFS-Realtime MSA Information Packet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NmuAUXon3jc4XajnEI7sKTOVSdeZifKQ/edit#slide=id.p1){:target="\_blank"} to understand the overall process and your next steps.

If you’d like to learn more about GTFS Realtime, or if you need an informational presentation to share with your staff or board of directors, please review this [GTFS-Realtime Introduction](/intro-gtfs-rt){:target="\_blank"}.

### What to know about MSAs?

The California Department of General Services (DGS), in collaboration with Cal-ITP, conducted a Request for Proposals that established three competitively awarded Master Service Agreements (MSAs), contracts that allow U.S. public transportation providers to purchase directly from California’s DGS without further competitive bidding.

The MSAs allow any local government entity that operates public transportation services (“transit providers”) to purchase goods and services off of California’s MSAs. Each transit provider should determine whether use of the MSAs is consistent with its procurement policies and regulations. California’s MSAs are generally known as State Purchasing Schedules in other states.

Projects resulting from these MSAs may be funded through grants from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and/or the State of California, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and other sources of local and state public funding. Check with your funding agencies.

### Do I need GTFS Schedule to create GTFS Realtime data?

Yes. In order to create GTFS Realtime data, you must first produce a compliant GTFS Schedule feed. Cal-ITP offers California agencies support with GTFS, including providing a monthly quality report on your GTFS Schedule and Realtime feeds via the [California GTFS Quality Dashboard](https://reports.calitp.org/){:target="\_blank"}. Technical experts are available to help California agencies in understanding the report and to assist you in resolving any errors.

### Do I need a connectivity solution?

Yes. You’ll need to ensure internet connectivity on your fleet to enable real-time location information. You can view [details on data plans](/how-to/get-connected){:target="\_blank"}. Your transit agency may be eligible to upgrade your cellular data plan and save on your monthly connectivity costs.

## Purchase

### Review available vendors

You can review [available MSAs](/contracts/view?contracts-filter-product=GTFS-Realtime){:target="\_blank"}. Click on each contract number for complete terms and conditions and to read MSA User Instructions.

### Draft a Scope of Work (SOW)

After you’ve read through the [GTFS Realtime MSA Information Packet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NmuAUXon3jc4XajnEI7sKTOVSdeZifKQ/edit#slide=id.p1){:target="\_blank"} and the [GTFS-Realtime Introduction](/intro-gtfs-rt){:target="\_blank"}, move on to [MSA SOW Template And Guidance](https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/MSA-SOW-Template-and-Guidance.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.

This PDF provides detailed guidance for transit agency staff on how to complete a User Agreement Scope of Work (SOW) as required to participate in the MSAs for GTFS Realtime Services. Completing an SOW will assist your agency with key scoping decisions as you work toward purchasing software services and optional hardware.

Cal-ITP can assist California transit agencies in drafting and/or reviewing their SOW, making sure it includes your desired operating objectives, intended operating environment, and any desired value-added services. Just send the SOW to [hello@calitp.org](mailto:hello@calitp.org){:target="\_blank"} when it’s ready if you haven’t already connected with Cal-ITP.

### Send the SOW to vendors

When you’re ready to send your SOW to vendors, you can find their contact information in the MSA User Instructions document (which is linked from the vendor’s contract number). We recommend sending the SOW to all MSA-awarded vendors.

An email template has been provided for you in the [MSA SOW Template And Guidance](https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/MSA-SOW-Template-and-Guidance.pdf){:target="\_blank"}. Be sure to CC [hello@calitp.org](mailto:hello@calitp.org){:target="\_blank"}. Unless otherwise specified by the transit agency, each vendor will respond within five business days of receiving the SOW.

### Review vendor proposals

Look over the proposals you receive from each vendor. Decide which vendor(s) you want to negotiate with. When you reach an agreement, including any necessary value-added services, you’re ready to place your order for software services, and optional hardware, by signing a contract for your purchases.

### Sign your contract

After you’ve finalized the details of your project with the vendor “contractors” you’ve selected, you’ll execute a User Agreement contract and sign it as the “contracting agency.” The User Agreement contract can be the Standard Agreement ([STD 213](https://www.dgs.ca.gov/ols/Forms?search=213&topicCategoryFilters=&audienceCategoryFilters=9048d318e266493abfd2361dc40d1f45&sort=relevance&activeFilters=audience%7C&page=1){:target="\_blank"}) from the California Department of General Services (DGS) or an equivalent contract form, such as this [Sample User Agreement](https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/User-Agreement-Contract-Form_MSA%205-21-70-28.docx){:target="\_blank"}, which can be used by transit providers across the U.S. The User Agreement will incorporate by reference the terms of the MSA and contain the Scope of Work and Payment Provisions.

## Implement

### Get ready to launch

You will work with your selected vendor to execute the jointly developed implementation plan and begin generating real-time data. Cal-ITP will continue to generate monthly data quality reports on your GTFS Schedule and Realtime feeds via the [California GTFS Quality Dashboard](https://reports.calitp.org/){:target="\_blank"}.

To request additional help from Cal-ITP, you can [contact us](/contact){:target="\_blank"} for assistance or send an email to [hello@calitp.org](mailto:hello@calitp.org){:target="\_blank"}.
