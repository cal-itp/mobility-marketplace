## Overview of the program

### How Remix can help your agency

This program will help streamline transit operations and provide a better transit rider experience through accessible Remix software procurement and access.

By offering Remix to qualifying agencies for free, Cal-ITP aims to:

- Help smaller transit providers plan, schedule, and report on operations more efficiently
- Make it simpler for agencies to produce and maintain high quality GTFS, or General Transit Feed Specification

With Remix, transit agencies gain access to:

- A central location to ingest, host, and synthesize multiple data sources about their communities, facilitating a more holistic analysis and decision-making
- Major data sets, such as Transportation Disadvantaged tracts, bikeshare stations, job sites
- The ability to upload your own agency-specific data sets into Remix

### What is Remix?

Remix is a software platform that allows transit agencies and cities to better plan public transportation systems and more easily schedule transit service.

Licenses distributed through this program will include:

- **Remix Transit**, the world’s first planning platform for fixed route transit. From small detours, to GTFS management, to full system redesigns, you can plan, evaluate, and collaborate on transit updates.
- **Remix Scheduling** allows you to take your plans from vision to implementation with nimble and intuitive software for blocking, runcutting, and rostering. It allows you to improve operational efficiency while saving your agency resources and staff time.
- **Remix GTFS Publisher** serves as a single source of truth for your fixed route system. Save time and meet the FTA compliance requirements with easy-to-use, self-serve tools. You can update your feeds while planning and scheduling your services, all in one place.

Both the Transit and Scheduling modules include **Remix Explore**, a geospatial data visualization and analysis tool that lets you bring your data together in one place.

For a more detailed overview of how Remix works, as well as the different modules available, we suggest [watching the demos featured on their website](https://info.ridewithvia.com/videos/remix-ben-peabody){:target="_blank"}. Please note: The Cal-ITP Remix Program does not offer access to the Streets module.

## Apply to the program

### Eligibility requirements

With a limited number of licenses available, during the first year of the program, priority will be given to agencies who have received **only** 5311 funding in the past 3 years. However, agencies who have received 5311 and 5307 funding are still encouraged to express their interest through the [intake form](https://share.hsforms.com/13WkzY7taSoSdxBATWsNedQ3aanu){:target="_blank"}.

We will extend access to 5311 + 5307 as soon as capacity allows, or once year two of the program begins.

If you have questions about your eligibility based on past funding, please see [Commonly asked questions](#commonly-asked-questions). If you do not qualify for this program, you can still purchase directly off the [Software Licensing Program (SLP)](/contracts/view?contracts-filter-product=Route planning and scheduling){:target="_blank"}. Reach out to your Cal-ITP Account Manager or [hello@calitp.org](mailto:hello@calitp.org) for assistance.

### How to apply

Fill out [an interest form](https://share.hsforms.com/13WkzY7taSoSdxBATWsNedQ3aanu){:target="_blank"} to apply for a free Remix license. The form should take about 10-15 minutes to fill out. You’ll share information about your current vendors, scheduling processes, and GTFS pipeline.

Within 30 days of submitting the interest form, agencies will be notified of whether or not they are eligible. Access to Remix Planning will be granted to eligible agencies within 7 days of that notification. Participating agencies will receive training and onboarding resources as well as access to Remix Scheduling and Remix GTFS Publisher within 30 days of the first login.

### Program requirements

Agencies selected for participation in this program will be required to: 

- Share existing tech stack and relevant tech vendor contracts with Cal-ITP
- Address any outstanding issues with their GTFS feed with the assistance of Cal-ITP and the Caltrans Transit Data Quality Team
- Attend regular check-ins and Remix trainings with their Cal-ITP Account Manager
- Provide administrator-level Remix account access to Cal-ITP to allow for technical assistance and product fit analysis
- Participate in regional coordination of the Remix implementation

There is also an expectation for participating agencies to utilize Remix as your primary tool for maintaining and publishing schedule data including the GTFS Schedule information submitted to trip planners and any CAD/AVL systems.

### Commonly asked questions

**If my agency doesn’t qualify immediately, how long will we have to wait to get our license?**

At this time, we cannot make an exact determination on when an individual agency may be eligible for funding. We encourage agencies to apply as early as possible, regardless of whether or not they are immediately eligible, as we aim to continuously admit qualifying applicants as soon as capacity allows.

**How many seats/licenses are available for access once accepted to the program?**

Qualified and accepted agencies participating in the Remix pilot will have unlimited access for all users for the duration of the program.

**When does the free license expire? And what happens after it expires?**

All licenses are set to expire on October 31, 2027. At the end of the license term (10/31/27), access to the platform will end. Current options to extend/renew exist in the form of purchasing via the Software Licensing Program (SLP).

**If my agency already has Remix, can we still apply?**

Yes. Other eligibility requirements still apply. Please note if you’re actively using Remix and apply for a free license through the program, you may have some additional eligibility considerations that will be evaluated on a case by case basis. If you have questions about your existing contract, please share them directly with your contact at Remix.
