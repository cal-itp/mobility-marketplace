      <p class="text-white">
        Study after study shows that transit riders have come to expect real-time vehicle arrival information. Knowing when a bus or train will actually arrive reduces uncertainty, increases the attractiveness of transit, and improves rider satisfaction.Â 
      </p>
      <p class="text-white">The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a data standard that public transit agencies use to get real-time (GTFS-RT) information to their riders. GTFS feeds allow public transit agencies to share their transit data, making it easier for developers to create applications that can use this information effectively. Transit service providers produce schedules and prices, third-party applications (like Apple Maps, Google Maps, Transit App, etc.) consume this data, and riders use this data to plan for their transit trip.</p>
