        There are hundreds of public transit providers in California with no consistent approach to collect fares, verify
        eligibility for fare discounts, or provide up-to-date vehicle arrival information to riders. This lack of uniformity
        creates barriers for new riders, complicates travel across different systems, and can be expensive for agencies to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created and managed by Caltrans, the California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP) is a statewide initiative to unify
        transit in California with a common fare payment system, real-time data standard, and seamless verification of
        reduced-fare eligibility. 
      </p>
      <strong>We are working to create a true marketplace</strong>
      <p>
        We want to ensure transit agencies have access to innovative and affordable technologies to enable a better experience for
        riders. While we’ve primarily worked with California agencies, we have products for agencies all across the country. Reach
        out or view our <a href="/contracts/">MSAs</a> to learn more.

        The California mobility market is large and complex but we want to make it simple for vendors and agencies to participate
        in a true marketplace: one with good products, with rapid and seamless procurement, and that leaves you with more time to
        deliver service to riders.

        To better understand the size and scale of opportunities in transportation, the Cal-ITP team compiled a list of
        California’s transit providers. Explore the more than 300 providers on our map and table, which links to each operator’s
        website and offers just a taste of our full dataset—a CSV download that includes fare revenues, fleet size, vehicle type,
        and more.
