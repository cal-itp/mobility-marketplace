  <h1>Route scheduling & planning tools</h1>
  <p>
    Cal-ITP has partnered with Remix to make powerful service planning and scheduling software available to agencies across
    California. Through the Software Licensing Program (SLP), any agency can purchase Remix’s tools at pre-negotiated rates. In
    addition, select transit agencies may qualify to receive free access through Cal-ITP’s Remix program. The program’s mission is
    to facilitate efficient transit operations, clearer reporting, and a better rider experience.

    Yes. Other eligibility requirements still apply. Please note if you’re actively using Remix and apply for a free license
    through the program, you may have some additional eligibility considerations that will be evaluated on a case by case basis.
