  <h1 class="text-center">Tap into the future of fare payment</h1>
  <p>
    California is making it easier for transit providers across the country to accept contactless credit, debit, mobile, or
    prepaid cards (including mobile wallets) through competitively awarded contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nearly 75% of Californians have access to a contactless bank card, and most have a smart device. Travelers are more likely to
    choose transit if they can use what’s already in their pocket to pay for it. Tap to pay increase ridership, agencies save on
    overhead—spending less servicing ticket vending machines and handling cash—and dwell times are cut in half as riders are able
    to board faster.
  </p>
  <p>
    Transit providers can take advantage of these MSAs to purchase hardware and software needed to accept contactless payments.

  <h4>Draft a Scope of Work (SOW)</h4>
  <p>
    Draft a scope of work using our <a href="/TK">SOW Template</a>. Completing an SOW will assist your agency with key decisions
    as you work toward purchasing hardware and software services. Be sure to specify your operating goals, technical environment,
    and any must-have features or services. Your Cal-ITP Account Manager can offer guidance and review your SOW before sending it
    to vendors.
  </p>
  <h3 class="numbered numbered_yellow my-4" data-number="3">Engage vendors</h3>
  <h4>Send SOW</h4>
  <p>
    We recommend sending the SOW to all MSA-awarded hardware and software services vendors. You can find their contact information
    in the MSA User Instructions document (which is linked from each vendor’s contract number).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use <a href="/TK">this email template</a> to send out your SOW, cc:
    <a href="mailto:hello@calitp.org">hello@calitp.org</a>. Unless otherwise specified by the transit agency, each vendor will
    respond within five business days of receiving the SOW.
  </p>
  <h3 class="numbered numbered_yellow my-4" data-number="4">Select vendor to purchase from</h3>
  <p>
    Look over the proposals you receive from each vendor and decide which vendors you want to negotiate with. When you reach an
    agreement, you’re ready to place your order by signing a User Agreement contract for your purchases. The User Agreement
    contract can be this <a href="/TK">Sample User Agreement</a> or the Standard Agreement (<a
      href="https://www.dgs.ca.gov/ols/Forms?search=213&topicCategoryFilters=&audienceCategoryFilters=9048d318e266493abfd2361dc40d1f45&sort=relevance&activeFilters=audience%7C&page=1"
      >STD 213<span aria-label="(external link)">↗</span></a
    >); the User Agreement will incorporate the terms of the MSA by reference, contain the scope of work and payment provisions. 
  </p>
  <h3 class="numbered numbered_yellow my-4" data-number="5">Implementation</h3>
  <h4>Get ready to launch</h4>
  <p>Cal-ITP can work with you to develop an operational launch plan for your agency, covering key elements such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hardware installation</li>
    <li>Fare calculation software configuration</li>
    <li>Payment processor onboarding</li>
    <li>End-to-end testing</li>
    <li>Soft launch to full launch</li>
    <li>Setting up finance dashboards</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additionally, templated <a href="/TK">staff training guides</a> and <a href="/TK">marketing materials</a> are available, which
    can be used for internal staff training, website copy, and rider communications.
  </p>
  <h4>Leverage a phased-approach</h4>
  <p>
    Consider approaching your roll out of tap to pay in phases. Riders will be able to benefit from this new, easier way to pay
    immediately. Then, you can continue to add additional features like additional discount offerings, promotional fare caps, and
    payment options for the un/underbanked to grow your tap to pay system over time.
  </p>
  <h4>Maintenance and support</h4>
  <p>
    Cal-ITP is here to help! Please download and review our <a href="/TK">Support Framework</a> - a document you can fill in and
    use to provide information to your internal team(s) about roles and responsibilities, common troubleshooting steps, how to
    manage your vendor relationships and how to monitor key performance outcomes.

  <div class="spacer-10"></div>
  <h2 class="mb-2 text-center">Additional info</h2>
  <h3>Commonly asked questions</h3>
  <h4>
    I understand the 3 requirements for contactless payments, do vendors provide all 3 requirements or do we pick and choose for
    each? Are prices transparent for agencies?
  </h4>
  <p>
    There are hardware vendors and software vendors. There are 7 vendors in total. All were awarded contracts which require that
    they are interoperable with each other. So you can pick a combination of vendors; if the combo has never been done, they are
    still required to integrate with each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pricing is included within the contracts. We also have a cost <a href="/TK">estimation calculator spreadsheet</a>. Vendors
    had to bid blind, so you will see a wide range. The cost estimator is an estimate and all numbers are the maximum they can
    charge. Consider negotiating with your vendor. Payment processor is a state contract, you get lower rates as transit provider.
  </p>
  <h4>What are MSAs?</h4>
  <p>
    The California Department of General Services (DGS), in collaboration with Cal-ITP, conducted a Request for Proposals (RFP)
    that established six competitively awarded Master Service Agreements (MSAs), contracts that allow U.S. public transportation
    providers to purchase directly from California’s DGS without further competitive bidding.
  </p>
  <p>
    The MSAs allow any local government entity that operates public transportation services (“transit providers”) to purchase
    goods and services off of California’s MSAs. Out-of-state transit providers can also participate. Each transit provider should
    determine whether use of the MSAs is consistent with its procurement policies and regulations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Projects resulting from these MSAs may be funded through grants from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and/or the
    State of California, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and other sources of local and state public funding.
    Check with your funding agencies.
  </p>
  <h4>Can I contract with Elavon or Fiserv directly or do I need to do a competitive bid?</h4>
  <p>
    You are free to complete a sole source purchase if your procurement rules allow you to do so. The important consideration is
    understanding certification timelines and costs associated with integrating the other parts of your system (your PADs and
    Transit Processor) with the Payment Processor of your choice.
  </p>
  <h4>Can I buy alongside multiple agencies?</h4>
  <p>
    Yes, Cal ITP has supported group-buys that fit different regional needs in payment and contracting, and can help guide the
    development of a memorandum of understanding.
  </p>
  <h4>How can I support unbanked riders?</h4>
  <p>
    We can advise on getting un/underbanked riders access to specialized, low- to no-cost accounts through
    <a href="https://www.calitp.org/resources/fact-sheet-enhancing-transit-experience-with-bankon">Bank On</a>.
  </p>
  <h4>Can I bring my own acquirer? [existing city/state banking relationship/contract]</h4>
  <p>
    Yes, please! Please ensure that your acquirer can process mass transit transactions (MTT), which are different from retail
    transactions.
  </p>
  <h4>How much are my merchant service/interchange rates?</h4>
  <p>For California agencies, this information can be found in Elavon and Fiserv’s respective EPAY agreements.</p>
  <p>
    For out of state agencies, Elavon has agreed to extend EPAY Terms, Conditions and Pricing from California to other agencies.
    Please confirm with Elavon, as Cal-ITP will not have visibility of these terms. Similarly, California’s “transit program”
    interchange discount for regulated debit cards - administered through Visa and Mastercard - will also apply.
  </p>
  <h4>What is a payment gateway and is this a separate contract?</h4>
  <p>
    A payment gateway transmits card information from your transit processor to the acquirer to facilitate a transaction. If you
    decide to contract with Elavon, a gateway is provided as part of the EPAY agreement (Cybersource is the gateway provider). You
    may need to engage with the payment gateway provider as part of the initial set-up, but this will be facilitated by either
    your payment processor or your transit processor.
  </p>
  <h4>Not in California?</h4>
  <p>
    Not in California? Follow this guide and incorporate the MSA into your contract. The MSAs listed on this site are examples of
    a “state purchasing schedule.” These schedules are agreements between a state or related entity and vendor(s) to provide goods
    or services at agreed-upon prices. Fundamentally, state purchasing schedules are designed to accommodate other parties that
    may enter into and benefit from the agreements in the future. You’ll sign a contract with the vendors directly. However, the
    terms and conditions (and pricing!) from the MSA are incorporated by reference in the contract that you will sign. You can use
    a California STD-213 or another DGS approved user agreement or equivalent.
