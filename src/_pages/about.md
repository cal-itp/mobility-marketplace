Welcome to the California Mobility Marketplace!

Managed by <a href="https://www.calitp.org/" target="_blank">Cal-ITP</a>, this website seeks to make the transition to contactless fare collection and GTFS Realtime compliance as easy and cost-effective as possible.

The California Mobility Marketplace gathers and presents links to a suite of standardized products and services that transit providers need in order to offer both contactless fare collection and GTFS Realtime, whether operating buses, commuter trains, or light rail.

The Mobility Marketplace serves as Cal-ITP’s online catalog, where transit providers can browse available goods and services and build a customized transit technology system that suits their needs. Visit our [contracts page](/contracts) to start exploring.
