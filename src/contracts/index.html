description: >
  California has Master Service Agreements (MSA) available to help you modernize
  your transit system, most of which are available to public transportation
  providers. The Mobility Marketplace serves as Cal-ITP’s online catalog where
  transit providers can browse available goods and services to build a system
  that suits their needs best.

      Recognizes riders' unique payment methods and charges the best fare for each trip, accounting for applicable

      the same benefits as pass holders once they reach the cap.

<strong class="h4">Contracts</strong>
<p class="pb-3">
  The State of California has Master Service Agreements (MSAs)—most of which are open to all public transportation providers in the U.S.—available to help you modernize your transit system. The Mobility Marketplace serves as Cal-ITP’s online catalog, where transit providers can browse available goods and services and build a customized transit technology system that suits their needs.
</p>

<strong class="h4">How do MSAs Work?</strong>
<p class="pb-3">
    The contracts or MSAs listed on this site are examples of a “state purchasing schedule.” These schedules are agreements between a state or related entity and vendor(s) to provide goods or services at agreed-upon prices. Fundamentally, state purchasing schedules are designed to accommodate other parties that may enter into and benefit from the agreements in the future.
</p>

    <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/docs/Third%20Party%20Contracting%20Guidance%20%28Circular%204220.1F%29.pdf" target="_blank">Guidance from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)</a> supports recipients in pursuing state purchasing schedules, given that agreement parties have granted express permission and all FTA and Federal requirements are met.

</p>

<strong class="h4">Contactless Fare Collection</strong>
<p class="pb-3">
    To add contactless fare collection, you will need up to three new technologies and ensure internet connectivity on your fleet (if you don’t already have it).
</p>

<strong class="h4">Become GTFS-compliant first for best results</strong> <em class="subtext">Highly recommended</em>
<p class="pb-4">
    We recommend creating an action plan for becoming GTFS-ready before going contactless, as the vendors you select can help you use this data for reporting purposes plus help your customers see your real-time vehicle location and fare information on journey-planning smartphone maps and apps.
