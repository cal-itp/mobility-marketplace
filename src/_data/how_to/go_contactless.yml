          - title: How do I get started?
          - text: Cal-ITP will provide the resource materials and technical support you need to navigate modernizing your fleet to accept contactless payments. To help us better assist you, we ask that you complete an <a href="/contact">interest form</a> to request Cal-ITP support. With this information, we can determine how best to support you with developing a project scope, getting buy-in from internal stakeholders, engaging with vendors, and implementing your new fare payments system.
          - text: After you complete the form, we welcome you to browse the <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/Contactless-Payments-MSA-Information-Packet.pdf" alt="Contactless Payments MSA Information Packet (PDF)">Contactless Payments MSA Information Packet (PDF)</a> to understand the overall process and your next steps.
          - title: What else do I need to know about contactless payments?
          - text: If you’d like to learn more about contactless payments or need an informational presentation to share with your staff or board of directors, please review this <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/Contactless-Payments-Introduction.pdf" alt="Contactless Payments Introduction (PDF)">Contactless Payments Introduction (PDF)</a>.
      - title: What to know about MSAs?
        url: "what-to-know-about-msas"
        paragraphs:
          - title: What are MSAs?
          - text: The California Department of General Services (DGS), in collaboration with Cal-ITP, conducted a Request for Proposals (RFP) that established six competitively awarded Master Service Agreements (MSAs), contracts that allow U.S. public transportation providers to purchase directly from California’s DGS without further competitive bidding.
          - text: The MSAs allow any local government entity that operates public transportation services (“transit providers”) to purchase goods and services off of California’s MSAs. Out-of-state transit providers—including but not limited to members of the Oregon Cooperative Procurement Program (ORCPP) and the Washington State Purchasing Cooperative (WSPC)—can also participate. Each transit provider should determine whether use of the MSAs is consistent with its procurement policies and regulations. California’s MSAs are generally known as State Purchasing Schedules in other states.
          - text: Projects resulting from these MSAs may be funded through grants from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and/or the State of California, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and other sources of local and state public funding. Check with your funding agencies.

          - text: <a target="_blank" href="https://dot.ca.gov/cal-itp/california-minimum-general-transit-feed-specification-gtfs-guidelines" alt="California Minimum General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Guidelines">General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)</a> is the global standard for providing up-to-date transit information. We recommend creating an action plan for becoming GTFS-ready before going contactless, as the contactless payment hardware and software services vendors you select can help you use this data for reporting purposes plus help your customers see your real-time vehicle location and fare information on journey-planning smartphone maps and apps.
      - title: Connectivity
        url: "connectivity"
        paragraphs:
          - text: You’ll need to ensure internet connectivity on your fleet to properly enable contactless fare collection. You can view details on Data Plans <a alt="Data Plans" href="/contracts/view?contracts-filter-product=Data%20Plans">here</a>. Your transit agency may be eligible to upgrade your cellular data plan and save on your monthly connectivity costs.
      - title: How much will this cost?
        url: "how-much-will-this-cost"
        paragraphs:
          - text: When you’re ready to start creating cost estimates for purchasing contactless payment hardware and software services, this <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/MSA-Cost-Estimation-Tool.xlsx">MSA Cost Estimation Tool (an Excel Workbook)</a> will help transit agency staff to a) compare MSA-awarded vendors’ maximum prices and develop ballpark estimates for budgeting purposes (and board presentations), and b) make scoping decisions as you prepare to email vendors during the vendor engagement phase.

          - text: This PDF provides detailed guidance for transit agency staff on how to complete a User Agreement Scope of Work (SOW) as required to participate in the MSAs for Payment Acceptance Devices (PADs) and Transit Processor Services. Completing an SOW will assist your agency with key scoping decisions as you work toward purchasing hardware and software services.
          - text: Cal-ITP can assist California transit agencies in drafting and/or reviewing their SOW, making sure it includes your desired operating objectives, intended operating environment, and any desired value-added services. Just send the SOW to <a href="mailto:hello@calitp.org">hello@calitp.org</a> when it’s ready if you haven’t already connected with Cal-ITP.

We recommend sending the SOW to all MSA-awarded hardware and software services vendors.
          - text: You can use <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.calitp.org/mobility-marketplace/MSA_VendorContact_EmailTemplate.docx">this email template</a> when sending out your SOW. Be sure to CC <a href="mailto:hello@calitp.org">hello@calitp.org</a>. Unless otherwise specified by the transit agency, each vendor will respond within five business days of receiving the SOW.
